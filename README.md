# Milestone-1
Took a Zillow dataset and performed EDA while using transformations and feature engineering to produce a dataset for a real estate company.
This was meant to showcase data to provide the company with educated decisions on whether or not to purchase the properties, and to be able to explain these properties to buyers.
To complete this, I needed to be able to take my features and engineered features and tune them to find the best model, which ended up being XGBoost.
